## Hello!
I am happy that I can make this profile README thing, so that I can say a few things about myself and my projects. 

Here are some projects I've been working on:
- Draft2Paper
  - summer AI research thing I worked on at my university
  - Involved scraping 100k+ PDFs and extracting the necessary information to feed it into an LLM
  - This would hopefully allow for an effective way for retrieving research papers based on an abstract you input, but it definitely needs more work... 😅 (i.e. not useful, but I learned a lot!)
 
- .dotfiles
  - My NixOS .dotfiles that I spent wayyy too much time on
  - I think they are very cool!

- obsidian-nvim
  - I am working on expanding `:Obsidian paste_img`'s functionality
  - I feel very useful doing this!
