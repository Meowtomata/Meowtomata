## Hello!
Welcome to my profile!

Here is a quick description of some of the projects I've been worked on:
- Draft2Paper - summer research project for my university where I create a machine learning backend to process 130k+ PDFs and extract features to convert them into training data 
- .dotfiles - my (almost) current Linux NixOS configuration
- obsidian-nvim - an open source project where I contributed an expansion to the `:Obsidian paste_img` command to support more image formats
- class-compiler - a compiler I built in C++ during my university class
